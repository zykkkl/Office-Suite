# Art Direction

This file defines the visual quality standards that apply to **every** presentation regardless of domain profile. Domain profiles (academic, business_insight, etc.) define WHAT to show. This file defines HOW it should look.

## 1. Visual Composition

### 1.1 Spatial Weight Distribution

Every slide has a **visual center of gravity** -- the point where the eye naturally rests. This is NOT necessarily the geometric center.

| Composition Type | Center of Gravity | Use When |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Symmetric | Geometric center | Formal authority (cover, chapter pages) |
| Rule of thirds | Intersection points at 1/3 and 2/3 | Dynamic content (image-heavy, editorial) |
| Golden ratio | ~61.8% from left edge | Premium feel (brand, luxury, cultural) |
| Diagonal tension | Opposing corners | Energy and movement (comparison, contrast) |

Office Suite canvas: 254mm x 142.875mm. The four rule-of-thirds intersection points are:
- (84.7mm, 47.6mm), (169.3mm, 47.6mm)
- (84.7mm, 95.3mm), (169.3mm, 95.3mm)

Place the **salience target** (the element that should attract the eye first) at or near one of these points. Never place the salience target at dead center on content pages -- center placement signals "this is a title page."

### 1.2 Visual Balance

Balance is not symmetry. It is the equilibrium of visual weight across the slide.

**Visual weight factors** (heavier = more weight):
- Dark colors > light colors
- Large elements > small elements
- High contrast > low contrast
- Dense texture > flat fill
- Sharp edges > soft edges

**Balance strategies**:
- **Symmetric balance**: Mirror elements across the vertical axis. Use for: covers, formal chapter pages. Risk: static, predictable.
- **Asymmetric balance**: A large element on one side balanced by multiple smaller elements on the other. Use for: content pages, editorial layouts. Creates dynamic interest.
- **Radial balance**: Elements radiate from a center point. Use for: hub-and-spoke diagrams, cycle graphics.

**Anti-pattern**: A slide with all visual weight concentrated in one quadrant, leaving the opposite quadrant completely empty. This is not "whitespace" -- it is imbalance.

### 1.3 Visual Flow

The eye follows a predictable path determined by element arrangement:

| Flow Pattern | Element Arrangement | Best For |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Z-pattern | Top-left -> Top-right -> Bottom-left -> Bottom-right | Information-dense pages with scanning behavior |
| F-pattern | Top horizontal scan -> Left vertical scan -> Secondary horizontal | Text-heavy pages |
| Center-out | Central element -> surrounding details | Hero moments, single-focus pages |
| Linear | Left-to-right or top-to-bottom sequence | Timeline, process, narrative progression |
| Layered | Foreground -> midground -> background | Depth and sophistication |

The page title, being the highest-contrast text element, anchors the flow start point. From there, the layout pattern determines the continuation path.

## 2. Color Harmony

### 2.1 Harmony Models

The 6-token palette must achieve internal harmony. Given that Office Suite uses a fixed palette per deck, harmony is established once in design.md and maintained across all pages.

| Model | Relationship | Character |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Monochromatic | Single hue, varied saturation/brightness | Refined, cohesive, sophisticated |
| Analogous | Adjacent hues on the color wheel | Harmonious, natural, comfortable |
| Complementary | Opposite hues | High contrast, vibrant, attention-grabbing |
| Triadic | Three equidistant hues | Balanced variety, energetic |

For Office Suite's 6-token system, the accent color and bg_primary establish the primary hue relationship. text_primary and text_muted are neutrals (achromatic or near-achromatic) that do not participate in hue harmony.

### 2.2 Contrast Standards

| Pair | Minimum Contrast Ratio | Purpose |
|------|----------------------|---------|
| text_primary on bg_primary | 7:1 (WCAG AAA) | Body text readability |
| text_muted on bg_primary | 4.5:1 (WCAG AA) | Caption readability |
| accent on bg_primary | 4.5:1 | Emphasis visibility |
| H1 text on bg_primary | 4.5:1 | Title visibility |
| text on bg_surface | 4.5:1 | Card content readability |

When selecting accent colors, verify contrast against BOTH bg_primary and bg_surface (cards).

### 2.3 Color Temperature Continuity

Maintain consistent temperature across the deck. A cool palette on slides 1-4 followed by a warm palette on slides 5-7 creates jarring discontinuity.

Exceptions for intentional punctuation:
- A warm accent on an otherwise cool deck creates a "spotlight" effect on key slides
- Dark-background slides in a light-background deck create dramatic emphasis

These temperature breaks should be **rare** (1-2 per deck) and **purposeful** (only on climactic slides).

## 3. Typography as Visual Art

### 3.1 Letterform Aesthetics

Typography is not just hierarchy encoding (covered in generate_slides.md). It is also **visual texture**.

| Quality | Parameter | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Weight rhythm** | Alternating bold and regular within a slide | Creates breathing rhythm in text blocks |
| **Size drama** | Extreme size contrast (H1 at 36pt next to Caption at 10pt) | Creates visual tension and premium feel |
| **Letter spacing** | Wide spacing on titles (1-2pt) | Evokes luxury, ceremony, formality |
| **Line height** | 1.3x for body, 1.1x for titles | Controls density and breathability |
| **Vertical rhythm** | Baseline alignment across card columns | Creates grid coherence |

### 3.2 Typographic Composition Rules

- **Maximum 2 font families per slide** (1 for titles, 1 for body). Single family preferred.
- **Contrast through weight and size**, not through multiple families.
- **Never use more than 4 distinct font sizes on a single slide.**
- **Title text should be short enough to fit on one line.** If the title wraps, it is too long -- shorten the title, do not shrink the font.
- **Body text alignment**: Left-aligned for sentences (default). Center-aligned only for short labels, badges, and tile content. Never center-align paragraphs.

## 4. Image Art Direction

### 4.1 Style Consistency

All images within a single deck must share a consistent visual treatment:

| Treatment | Description | When to Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Original | No modification beyond sizing | Product photos, screenshots, data visualizations |
| Desaturated | Reduced saturation (30-60%) | Background images, atmospheric photos |
| Duotone | Two-color mapping (accent + bg_primary) | Hero images on cover/chapter pages |
| Masked | Semi-transparent color overlay | Images that need text readability on top |
| Cropped | Aggressive crop to focus on subject | Character photos, product details |

**Rule**: Within one deck, all non-data images use the same treatment. Mixing treatment styles (e.g., one photo in full color, another in duotone) creates visual incoherence.

### 4.2 Image-Text Coexistence

When text overlays an image:
- Apply a semi-transparent overlay (50-70% opacity of bg_primary) between the image and text
- Ensure text contrast ratio meets 4.5:1 against the overlaid result
- Text should be placed over the least visually busy region of the image
- Prefer bottom-placed text on landscape images (sky/top tends to be visually lighter)

### 4.3 Image Sourcing Standards

| Criterion | Minimum Standard |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Resolution | >= 1200px on the long edge |
| Aspect ratio | Match the target container; crop rather than stretch |
| Watermarks | None |
| Relevance | Directly supports the slide's key message |
| Quality | Publication-grade (no phone screenshots, no low-res internet grabs) |

## 5. Visual Rhythm Across the Deck

### 5.1 Density Pacing

A deck should have **rhythmic variation** in visual density, not uniform density throughout:

```
Slide 1 [cover]:     SPARSE (high impact, minimal content)
Slide 2 [content]:   BALANCED (standard density)
Slide 3 [content]:   DENSE (information-heavy)
Slide 4 [content]:   BALANCED (recovery)
Slide 5 [content]:   DENSE (data-heavy)
Slide 6 [content]:   BALANCED (decompression)
Slide 7 [closing]:   SPARSE (high impact, minimal content)
```

The pattern: sparse open -> build density -> decompress -> peak density -> sparse close. This creates a narrative rhythm that sustains attention.

### 5.2 Composition Rhythm

Consecutive slides should NOT use the same composition skeleton. The rule of non-repetition:

- Maximum 2 consecutive slides with the same skeleton
- After a dense composition (large grid, complex chart, or multi-label diagram), follow with a simpler or more spacious composition
- Chapter/transition pages break the content layout sequence, but should still express the deck's motif

### 5.3 Color Rhythm

Accent color usage should have rhythm:
- Use accent on 60-80% of content slides (for titles at minimum)
- Reserve slides without accent for dramatic contrast (a fully monochrome page followed by accent reintroduction)
- Never use accent for more than 30% of any single slide's visual area (accent is emphasis, not fill)

## 6. Card Visual Quality

### 6.1 Card Aesthetics

Cards in Office Suite follow these visual standards:

| Parameter | Standard | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Corner radius | 3mm (all cards, no variation) | Consistency reduces processing cost |
| Border | 1pt, border token color | Subtle containment signal |
| Fill | bg_surface token | Distinct from page background |
| Internal padding | 4mm on all sides | Content breathing room |
| Shadow | None | Flat design for clean rendering |

### 6.2 Card Grid Alignment

Cards in a grid must be:
- **Same width**: All cards in a row share identical width
- **Same height**: All cards in a group share identical height
- **Even spacing**: 4mm gap between cards, consistent in both axes
- **Aligned to grid**: Left edges aligned, top edges aligned

### 6.3 Card Content Density

| Card Width | Max Title Length | Max Body Length |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| 32mm | 6 characters | 20 characters |
| 50mm | 10 characters | 40 characters |
| 68mm | 14 characters | 60 characters |
| 103mm | 20 characters | 100 characters |

If content exceeds these limits, either shorten the text or increase the card width.

## 7. Decoration Philosophy

### 7.1 Decoration = Information

Every visual element on a slide must carry information. "Decoration" in Office Suite means functional visual elements:

| Element | Information Carried |
|---------|-------------------|
| Divider line | "Below is a new section" |
| Card border | "These elements belong together" |
| Accent color on title | "This is the most important text" |
| Diamond shape (closing) | "This is the end" |
| Page marker | "You are here in the deck" |

### 7.2 Prohibited Decorative Patterns

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Drop shadows | Creates false depth hierarchy |
| Gradient fills on cards | Adds visual noise without information |
| Decorative borders (double, dashed, ornamental) | Signals decoration over content |
| Background textures | Competes with content for attention |
| Animated GIFs or emoji | Breaks professional visual tone |
| Stock watermarks | Destroys credibility |
| Decorative shapes unrelated to content | Consumes spatial budget without meaning |

### 7.3 Permitted Decorative Elements

| Element | Constraint |
|---------|-----------|
| Thin horizontal lines | 0.5mm height, accent color, for section separation only |
| Diamond/rhombus shapes | Closing pages only, as visual punctuation |
| Gradient overlays on images | For text readability, not decoration |
| Rounded rectangles | Card containers only (not standalone decoration) |

## 9. Domain-Specific Art Overrides

Some domain profiles override specific art direction rules:

| Domain | Override |
|--------|---------|
| promotion | Center placement IS allowed on content pages (slogan pages) |
| promotion | Gradient overlays on solid backgrounds ARE permitted (atmospheric depth) |
| promotion | Large whitespace IS intentional (not imbalance) |
| business_insight | Accent color may be used for >30% of a chart's visual area |
| education | Up to 4 semantic colors ARE permitted (beyond the 6-token limit) for knowledge category coding |

When a domain profile conflicts with this file, the domain profile takes precedence. This file is the baseline; profiles are the exceptions.
